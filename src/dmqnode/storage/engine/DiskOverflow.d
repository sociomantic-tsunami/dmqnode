    Message queue with channels using file storage

    The queue operates on one file and uses queue channels. Pushing to any
    channel appends the pushed record to the file so all records of all
    channels are in the file in the order of pushing. Each record consists of
    a fixed size header of type RecordHeader, followed by the record payload.
    The record header contains
      - the byte length of the record payload,
      - the relative file position to the next record in the same channel
        (except for the last record in a channel) and
      - a channel ID number identifying the channel the record belongs to.

    For each channel the file position of the first (next to pop) and last (most
    recently pushed) record is tracked.
    Pushing
      - sets the position tracker of the last record in the channel to the end
        of the file and
      - adjusts the last (most recently pushed) record in the same channel to
        also point to the end of the file, which is the file position of the
        newly pushed record, then
      - appends the new record to the file.

    Popping reads the record at the file position of the "first" tracker and
    advances that tracker to the next record in the same channel as reported in
    the header of that record.

    The tracked positions, channel names, number of records and total number of
    record payload in each channel are written to an index file on shutdown to
    be restored on the next startup. The format of this file is ASCII text:
     - One line per channel.
     - Each line consists of

           {channel name} {records} {bytes} {first-position} {last-position}

       where {channel name} is a string and {records}, {bytes},
       {first-position}, {last-position} are decimal numbers. The tokens are
       whitespace separated. For example,

           MyChannel 3049 1540516 5040 9590357

       means, channel "MyChannel" has 3049 records with a total payload of
       1540516 bytes, the first record is at file position 5040 and the last at
       9590357.

    Channel names and channel IDs

    Each channel has a channel name and a channel ID. The channel ID is a
    positive integer value. The ID of the channel each record belongs to is
    stored in the header of the record in the data file when the record is
    pushed.
    The channel names are stored in the index file.
    When a new channel is created, the highest of all currently used channel IDs
    plus 1 is assigned to it.
    Starting with an empty disk overflow without any channel, this highest ID is
    0 so the channel that is created first has channel ID 1, the next one 2 and
    so on. At startup, if loading data stored on the previous shutdown, each
    channel name is read from the index file and the corresponding channel ID
    from the first record in the channel.

    Data validation and version check

    The first eight bytes of the data file are a magic ASCII string (not NUL-
    terminated) that includes a version number. It is checked on initialisation
    during startup.

    RecordHeader uses an 8-bit horizontal parity (that is, the exclusive OR of
    all bytes in the struct) as a basic protection should the tracker positions
    be wrong because of a program bug.

    Saving data on shutdown and loading them on startup

    On shutdown the states of the channels trackers must be written to the index
    file. For the data file the current operation (push, pop or clear) must be
    allowed to finish if shutdown is requested while performing an operation.
    Except for that the data file does not need any special shutdown handling.

    If an index and data file exists on startup then the startup sequence is:
     - Verify the data file ID (the magic string in the first eight bytes).
     - Parse the index file and create all channels that are mentioned in it.
     - For each channel read the first and last record of the channel from the
       data file assign their channel ID (both should have the same) to the
       channel.

    All steps involve sanity checks, and startup will fail if any of the checks
    fails.

    An up-to-date index file is of critical importance to restore the previous
    state on startup. Because of that the index file is periodically written to
    disk, the time interval can be configured and is 60 seconds by default.

    An outdated but not otherwise corrupted index file will cause the
    follwing issues at startup:
     - For a channel that has been pushed to in the mean time the "next" field
       the record at the "last" position according to the index file will not be
       0 (which indicates it is really the last record in the channel but point
       to another record. This can be fixed by following the chain of the
       following records in the data file until the really last record of the
       channel is found (whose "next" field in the header is 0).
     - Records that have been popped from a channel in the mean time will be in
       the queue again. There is no way of telling which records were already
       popped.
     - A channel that has been created in the mean time can only be recovered by
       parsing the whole data file and looking for chains of records that are
       not referenced by the index. However, such a chain could also be a
       deleted channel, and there is no way of telling which it is. The channel
       name is lost.
     - A channel that has been deleted in the mean time will be resurrected,
       possibly with outdated push and pop file positions.

    An outdated push position (i.e. the supposedly last record isn't really the
    last one) is the only of these four conditions that can be (and are)
    detected by sanity checks.

    I/O details and performance concerns

    Data file I/O involved in push and pop operation uses POSIX pread(),
    pwrite() and writev(). Of these functions only writev() uses the implicit
    file position, which is always at the end of the file. Writing pwrite()s a
    record header (<100 B), then writev()s a full record (header plus payload).
    When writing in a high frequency to one or more channels then the seeking
    distance for pwrite() is most of the time the length of one record. Reading
    pread()s one record from a low file position. When reading in a high
    frequency from one channel without writing in between then reading is purely
    sequential but involves skipping records that belong to other channels.

    Of each data chunk that is written to the file the first <100B (the record
    header) are later (mostly very soon) overwritten once. All data that were
    written to the file are read exactly once so reading could benefit from the
    "Don't Reuse" POSIX file advice. However, that file advice is not
    implemented in Linux (unless it was added recently), and testing with Linux
    3.0.0-32-generic did not yield any noticeable performance gain.

    Currently blocking I/O is used; if that proves to harm server operation,
    non-blocking epoll-multiplexed I/O will be used instad. Note that on Linux
    non-blocking file I/O is currently only partly implemented and depends on
    the file system; reading should work but writing may sometimes still block.
    At least for the queue node server sporadic stalls are not critical as long
    as the server can keep up with the throughput for channels that aren't
    overflown.

    Index file I/O uses C stdio streams to allow for text formatting and
    parsing.

    Certain POSIX I/O functions fail with EINTR if they were interrupted by a
    signal (more precisely, if a signal was raised before they read or wrote any
    byte of data). In this case these functions just need to be called again;
    this is taken care of. If a signal is raised while a C stdio stream function
    is executing, it is impossible to restore a valid state and ensure valid
    output data. Because valid output to the index file is very important all
    signals are blocked during index file I/O (except for a couple of fatal ones
    including SIGABRT and SIGSEGV). Signals that should be blocked during index
    file I/O include SIGINT and SIGTERM to prevent incomplete file output if the
    user initiates an application shutdown (for example by pressing Ctrl+C) in
    that moment.

        Miminizes the size of the data file by truncating the beginning of the
        file, as follows:
        The data file starts with an 8-byte identifier string,
        `Constants.datafile_id`, and the records follow that string. After
        records have been popped, there may be a contiguous range of already
        popped records between the identifier string and the first record in the
        data file that hasn't been popped yet. If such a range exists then this
        method will
         - truncate the data file from the beginning, removing the largest
           integer multiple of `DataFile.head_truncation_chunk_size` (1 MiB)
           that is less than the size of the range and
         - fill the range remaining after the truncation with a dummy record
           with channel id = 0 and bytes of zero value as the record data,
         - adjust the `first_offset` of all channels to reference the new
           position of the next record to pop.

        For example, suppose there is a range of 2.5 MiB of already popped
        records between the data file ID and the first not yet popped record, so
        the file layout looks like this:

                        |<-- 2.5 MiB  -->|
            datafile_id popped_records... first_not_yet_popped_record

        Then this method will do the following:

        1. Truncate the data file from the beginning, removing 2 MiB, which is
           the largest integer multiple of 1 MiB that is less than 2.5 MiB,
           leaving `datafile_id.length` + 0.5 MiB of junk at the beginning of
           the file:

            |<- datafile_id.length ->|<- 0.5 MiB ->|
            junk                     junk           first_not_yet_popped_record

        2. Write the data file ID to the new beginning of the data file:

                        |<-- 0.5 MiB -->|
            datafile_id junk             first_not_yet_popped_record

        3. Fill the remaining junk with a dummy record:

                        |<-- 0.5 MiB -->|
            datafile_id dummy_record     first_not_yet_popped_record

        The essential file operations are done using Linux `fallocate()`
          - in `FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE` mode to truncate the data file from
            the beginning,
          - in `FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE` mode to write bytes of zero value as dummy
            record data.

        This is supported only by Linux 3.15 or higher and only for certain file
        systems including ext4 and XFS. See the `fallocate()` manual page for
        details. The constructor of this class does a run-time test if
        `fallocate()` supports these modes, and this method does nothing if that
        test failed.

        Returns:
            the number of bytes removed from the data file, which is 0 if
            nothing was done.
